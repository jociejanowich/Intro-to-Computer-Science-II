# Intro-to-Computer-Science-II
##  Overview
This repository contains projects completed during **Computer Science II (COSC 237)** at **Towson University**.  
The course builds on CS I, introducing **data structures, algorithms, and advanced object-oriented programming** in Java.  

Topics covered include:  
- Recursion  
- Linked lists, stacks, queues  
- Binary trees and tree traversal  
- Sorting and searching algorithms  
- Exception handling and modular program design  

Projects demonstrate **problem-solving, modular coding, and algorithm implementation skills**.
